#🌾 Crop Prediction System using Machine Learning & Flask

A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the **most suitable crop** to grow based on soil and weather conditions.
This project integrates an ML model with a Flask web framework to provide real-time crop recommendations.

📌 Project Overview

Agriculture plays a vital role in our economy, and choosing the right crop is crucial for better yield.
This project helps farmers and users by predicting the best crop using parameters such as:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH value
- Rainfall

The trained ML model takes these inputs and predicts the most suitable crop.
